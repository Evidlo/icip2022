# todo
- change algorithm diagram y_k to star field
- introduction: "with unconstrained motion" -> "with unconstrained translation"
- emphasize algorithm and paper simulation code availability
- reword this: Additionally,
registering and fusing images sequences on-board rather
than on the ground can significantly increase the science
return with the limited data downlink budget available
